# Acetaminophen (Paracetamol) — Safe but Dangerous

**Discovery Story**  
Introduced in the 1950s as an alternative to aspirin.

**Medicinal Chemistry Principle**  
- Safe at therapeutic dose.  
- High doses overwhelm metabolism → toxic NAPQI metabolite → liver damage.  

**Interactive Idea (future)**  
Dose slider: low = safe, high = liver toxicity visual.
