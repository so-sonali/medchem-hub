# Imatinib (Gleevec) — Targeted Therapy Pioneer

**Discovery Story**  
Approved in 2001 for chronic myeloid leukemia. First highly successful targeted cancer therapy.

**Medicinal Chemistry Principle**  
- Kinase inhibitor: locks ATP binding site.  
- Illustrates molecular targeting and selectivity.  

**Interactive Idea (future)**  
Show kinase as a machine → imatinib “wrench” jams it → cancer cell growth stops.
