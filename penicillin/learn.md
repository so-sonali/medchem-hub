# Penicillin — The β-Lactam Revolution

**Discovery Story**  
Discovered by Alexander Fleming (1928), developed by Florey & Chain (1940s). Nobel Prize awarded.

**Medicinal Chemistry Principle**  
- Inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis.  
- Resistance via β-lactamases → led to amoxicillin and other derivatives.  

**Interactive Idea (future)**  
Visual: bacteria shield with β-lactamase enzyme → student modifies penicillin to resist.
